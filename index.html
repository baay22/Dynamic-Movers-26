                <p>Moving can be hard. Most people <i>shiver at the thought of moving day rolling around the corner</i> and a frenzy ensues. However, it doesn’t need to be like that. One way to ensure that doesn’t happen is to hire <a href="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/"> NYC movers and packers</a>. By hiring them you are, first and foremost, guaranteeing that you will <b>stay on top of your moving schedule</b>. Secondly, there is <b>no risk of injury</b> on your part from lifting heavy objects. Furthermore, you can <b>spend more quality time with your family</b>. However,  that doesn’t mean you don’t have to do anything before professional packers and movers arrive. Here are some ways in which you can improve the quality and speed of your relocation.</p>

                <h2>The number one thing to do before professional packers and movers arrive</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>If there is one key take away we want you to leave with from this article, it is that you should definitely <a href="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/how-to-declutter-before-moving/"> declutter before moving</a>. Logically speaking, <i>the fewer items your movers have to pack the faster the move will be</i>. The fewer things they need to transport the less the cost of hiring movers. So, it’s really a beneficial thing to do.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 200px; width: 30%;" src="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2-300x200.jpg"></div>
                <p><h4>Research suggests that decluttering can also have the added benefit of helping you be more calm and relaxed.</h4></p>
                <p>So, how do you approach decluttering? Well, we recommend that you use the <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/home/organizing/a25846191/what-is-the-konmari-method/"> KonMari method</a>. It’s not only a useful tool when getting rid of things, but also a <b>good method for keeping your belongings organized and under lock and key</b>. There are a lot of nooks and crannies to the method, but the general gist is asking yourself the question of whether the item you want to throw away sparks joy. If it does then you keep it. However, if it doesn’t you get rid of it.</p>

                <h2>I don’t trust the movers with my belongings, what should I do?</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>We often hear people say that they do not wish to hire movers because they don’t feel comfortable leaving their precious belongings in the hands of a third party. And to be completely honest with you, <b>we understand</b>. However, there are a couple of things you should know. First of all, when hiring a moving company, like <a href="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/services/local/manhattan-movers/upper-east-side/"> Upper East Side movers</a>, your belongings are in the <i>hands of professionals</i>. People whose job it is to take good care of your belongings. Secondly, movers have <b>special equipment</b> that is used in order to prevent damages from occurring on your belongings during the transport. Lastly, if damage does occur most good and reliable moving companies offer insurance to <b>compensate you for any damages</b>. So, at the end of the day, you are in good hands.</p>
            <section><h3>However…</h3></section>
                <p>If you still feel unsafe about leaving your specialty items to movers, you can always decide to move them by yourself. Just make sure you separate them from all of the other belongings the movers will be relocating. That way, no confusion takes place once moving day comes rolling around the corner.</p>

                <h2>What else should I do before professional packers and movers arrive?</h2>

            <section>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 200px; width: 30%;" src="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3-e1595190660729-294x300.jpg"></div>
                <p><h4>Don’t forget to label your own boxes!</h4></p>
                <section>
                    <p>Another important thing you should do is to <a href="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/what-is-the-best-way-to-label-moving-boxes/"> label moving boxes</a>. This is of crucial importance and should not be overlooked. God forbid that after a long day of traveling you come home to unpack, unable to find your phone charger. So, let’s try to not make that happen. The best way of labeling moving boxes is to <b>create a moving index</b>. For example, you should label the moving boxes with numbers. Then, open up your laptop or phone and create a new note. In this note, you should write down the number and then all the contents of the moving box that corresponds with that number. This way you will know exactly where your items are.</p>
                <section><h3>Prepare your furniture</h3></section>
                    <p>Okay, so another important thing to do before professional packers and movers arrive is to <b>prepare your bulky furniture for moving</b>. <i>So what do we mean by this?</i> Well, grab a tape measure and measure the width of the door and see whether your bed can fit through it or not. So, when movers arrive they can know <b>exactly what to disassemble and what they can move without taking the furniture apart</b>. Also, while you don’t have to do this, we recommend that you also wrap your furniture into blankets or protective pads to help shave off some time for the movers.</p>

                <h2>Do clean your house before professional packers and movers arrive</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>So, hopefully, by now you have decluttered your home, hired a moving company, and created a moving index. Everything is going according to plan. However, we would like to mention that you should also clean up your house before professional movers arrive. Things like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <ul>
                        <ul>
                            <p><li><b>Cleaning the kitchen appliances;</b></li></p>
                            <p><li><b>Either remove the drawers from your desk or empty them out;</b></li></p>
                            <p><li><b>Remove any decorations from the furniture you’ll be carrying with you;</b></li></p>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>are an absolute must. Simply put, you don’t want the state of your old house to ruin the feel of the new house. So make sure to clean your house!</p>

                <h2>Last but by no means least…</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Make sure <b>you are there</b> once moving day comes. You need to be there to provide all the appropriate information, direction, and even assistance if the occasion for that arises.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, make sure your kids and or pets are with relatives. Or at the very least, make sure that there is someone to look after them. Away from all the stress and tension of the moving day.</p>
                <p>And lastly, <b>don’t forget to check the weather</b>. Sometimes people get so caught up in their everyday life that they forget to take the necessary steps to negate the negative weather. Things like covering the floors with newspaper and covering your furniture in plastic wrap., are considered to be a must.</p>
